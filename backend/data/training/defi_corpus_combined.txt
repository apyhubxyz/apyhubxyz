Why
 
Liquity's
 
Forkanomics
 
Will
 
Rejuvenate
 
L2s
 
We're
 
all
 
familiar
 
with
 
the
 
benefits
 
of
 
Liquity's
 
friendly
 
fork
 
strategy:
 
For
 
Liquity:
 
●
 
Incentives
 
●
 
Mindshare
 
●
 
Eco
 
expansion
 
For
 
the
 
fork-teams:
 
●
 
Secure,
 
fresh
 
code
 
●
 
Exclusivity
 
●
 
Branding
 
Now,
 
let's
 
address
 
the
 
elephant
 
in
 
the
 
room:
 
how
 
L2s/chains
 
will
 
benefit
 
from
 
it.
 
Many
 
of
 
these
 
ecosystems
 
face
 
the
 
same
 
challenges:
 
●
 
Stablecoin
 
liquidity
 
●
 
Use
 
cases
 
for
 
the
 
gov
 
token
 
●
 
Finding
 
value-aligned
 
builders
 
Let's
 
break
 
them
 
down.
 

Stablecoin
 
Liquidity
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
PvP
 
game,
 
where
 
L2s
 
are
 
pitted
 
against
 
each
 
other .
 
With
 
limited
 
liquidity
 
available,
 
capital
 
flows
 
to
 
where
 
it's
 
most
 
incentivized
 
Attracting
 
stablecoin
 
liquidity
 
is
 
expensive
 
and
 
will
 
only
 
become
 
more
 
so.
 
With
 
a
 
Liquity
 
V2
 
fork
 
you
 
get
 
it
 
for
 
free!
 
Moreover ,
 
you
 
can
 
issue
 
the
 
stablecoin
 
against
 
your
 
governance
 
token,
 
which
 
ties
 
into
 
problem
 
no.
 
2.
 
Use
 
cases
 
for
 
the
 
gov
 
token
 
For
 
many
 
chains,
 
a
 
significant
 
part
 
of
 
their
 
TVL
 
is
 
canonical,
 
meaning,
 
compromised
 
of
 
their
 
own
 
gov
 
token.
 
This
 
capital
 
often
 
sits
 
idle,
 
failing
 
to
 
generate
 
meaningful
 
value.
 
With
 
a
 
V2
 
fork,
 
they
 
can
 
utilize
 
their
 
gov
 
token
 
as
 
the
 
primary
 
collateral
 
for
 
issuing
 
the
 
new
 
native
 
stablecoin.
 
Finding
 
value-aligned
 
builders
 
Teams
 
that
 
deploy
 
a
 
fork
 
on
 
a
 
specific
 
chain
 
have
 
a
 
vested
 
interest
 
in
 
that
 
chain's
 
success.
 
They
 
aim
 
to
 
become
 
the
 
go-to
 
liquidity
 
hub,
 
attracting
 
users,
 
partnerships,
 
and
 
grants.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
they'll
 
be
 
active
 
participants
 
in
 
governance
 
decisions,
 
using
 
their
 
accumulated
 
voting
 
power
 
to
 
drive
 
L2
 
growth
 
as
 
a
 
whole.
 
This
 
benefits
 
them,
 
as
 
the
 
core
 
CDP,
 
significantly .
 
If
 
you're
 
part
 
of
 
an
 
L2
 
foundation,
 
don't
 
wait
 
–
 
take
 
action
 
to
 
create
 
native
 
liquidity
 
and
 
attract
 
motivated
 
builders
 
at
 
no
 
cost.
 
Berachain
 
and
 
Hyperliquid
 
already
 
announced
 
their
 
teams
 
with
 
@beraborrow
 
and
 
@felixprotocol
 
,
 
and
 
many
 
more
 
are
 
still
 
in
 
stealth.
 
Become
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
this
 
movement

Make
 
DeFi
 
Great
 
Again!

I
 
love
 
this
 
one.
 
One
 
reason
 
it
 
works
 
is
 
because
 
@LiquityProtocol
 
has
 
incredibly
 
low
 
borrow
 
rates,
 
allowing
 
for
 
capital
 
efficient
 
basis
 
trading.
 
On
 
top
 
of
 
that,
 
you
 
get
 
a
 
fixed
 
rate
 
on
 
the
 
loan,
 
making
 
the
 
overall
 
yield
 
much
 
less
 
volatile.
 
And
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
wstETH
 
as
 
collateral.

Here's
 
the
 
strategy
 
TL;DR:
 
►
 
Long
 
wstETH
 
►
 
Use
 
wstETH
 
as
 
collateral
 
on
 
Liquity
 
►
 
Borrow
 
50%
 
LTV
 
in
 
Bold
 
at
 
a
 
fixed
 
rate
 
►
 
Convert
 
BOLD
 
to
 
syrupUSDC
 
►
 
Bridge
 
syrupUSDC
 
to
 
Solana
 
►
 
Deposit
 
as
 
margin
 
on
 
Drift
 
►
 
Open
 
a
 
2x
 
ETH
 
short
 
(value
 
of
 
your
 
wstETH
 
long)
 
Net:
 
21%

There
 
are
 
some
 
risks
 
here:
 
➢
 
If
 
BOLD
 
depegs
 
you
 
could
 
be
 
redeemed
 
on
 
Liquity ,
 
so
 
you
 
may
 
want
 
to
 
use
 
a
 
delegate
 
to
 
manage
 
your
 
loan.
 
(That
 
said,
 
if
 
BOLD
 
depegs
 
and
 
you
 
buy
 
it
 
back
 
at
 
a
 
discount,
 
you
 
can
 
actually
 
close
 
at
 
a
 
nice
 
additional
 
arbitrage
 
profit)
 
➢
 
Incentives
 
on
 
Drift
 
may
 
not
 
last
 
forever ,
 
but
 
that
 
would
 
only
 
lose
 
you
 
2%
 
net
 
on
 
your
 
strategy .
 

➢
 
Funding
 
rates
 
are
 
typically
 
great
 
on
 
Drift
 
but
 
could
 
go
 
against
 
you
 
for
 
prolonged
 
periods
 
during
 
a
 
desperate
 
bear
 
market.
 
Also,
 
if
 
ETH
 
shoots
 
up
 
by
 
30%,
 
you
 
may
 
have
 
to
 
re-adjust
 
your
 
position
 
to
 
avoid
 
liquidation.

This
 
is
 
somewhat
 
complex
 
strategy
 
for
 
newer
 
DeFi
 
users,
 
but
 
for
 
seasoned
 
strategists,
 
I
 
think
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
winning
 
trade
 
with
 
good
 
longevity .
 
The
 
fact
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
used
 
yield-bearing
 
margin
 
on
 
drift
 
combined
 
with
 
yield
 
bearing
 
collateral
 
on
 
bold
 
PLUS
 
funding
 
rate
 
yield,
 
all
 
which
 
are
 
predictably
 
positive,
 
makes
 
this
 
nice
 
for
 
a
 
good
 
low-maintenance
 
play
 
at
 
a
 
highly
 
competitive
 
delta
 
neutral
 
yield
 
imo.
 
Also
 
note:
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
@InterportFi
 
to
 
bridge
 
over
 
syrupUSDC
 
to
 
Solana.

There
 
are
 
some
 
slippage
 
in
 
swapping
 
to
 
wstETH/SyrupUSD,
 
mainnet
 
gas
 
fees,
 
bridge
 
costs,
 
cost
 
of
 
opening/closing
 
trades.
 
safe
 
to
 
say,
 
it’s
 
good
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
at
 
least
 
$10K
 
and
 
plan
 
to
 
park
 
it
 
for
 
multiple
 
months
 
for
 
it
 
to
 
be
 
worth
 
it.
 
For
 
degens
 
there
 
is
 
no
 
way
 
I
 
can
 
park
 
that
 
long.

The
 
major
 
benefit
 
is
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
withdraw
 
at
 
any
 
time
 
and
 
not
 
worry
 
about
 
unstaking.

the

vault
 
borrows
 
USDC
 
against
 
WETH
 
and
 
leveraged
 
srUSD
 
on
 
the
 
users

The
 
vault
 
typically
 
averages
 
around
 
6%
 
(already
 
great)
 
but
 
since
 
wsrUSD
 
has
 
gone
 
to
 
15%
 
APY,
 
the
 
vault
 
has
 
been
 
doing
 
nearly
 
20%
 
on
 
the
 
underlying
 
WETH.

There's
 
a
 
secret
 
strategy
 
that
 
only
 
the
 
nerds
 
know .
 
It
 
involves
 
@protocol_fx
 
and
 
@DriftProtocol
 
.
 
IN
 
SHOR T,
 
long
 
on
 
f(x)
 
short
 
on
 
Drift.
 
No
 
funding
 
/
 
Interest
 
on
 
the
 
long.
 
Good
 
yield
 
on
 
the
 
short,
 
yield
 
on
 
margin.
 
Example:
 
$10,000
 
Margin
 
f(x)
 
for
 
2x
 
($20,000
 
Long)
 
position
 
$5,000
 
USDC
 
margin
 
2x
 
(10,000
 
Short)
 
position
 
You
 
are
 
now
 
1x
 
long
 
on
 
10K
 
of
 
ETH
 
using
 
15K
 
principal
 

You
 
get
 
0%
 
yield
 
on
 
the
 
long
 
BUT,
 
you
 
get
 
9%
 
on
 
your
 
margin
 
and
 
15%
 
your
 
notional
 
short.
 
Net
 
APR:

This
 
is
 
a
 
no
 
brainer
 
both
 
because
 
the
 
yields
 
are
 
consistently
 
over
 
10%
 
and
 
because
 
you
 
get
 
a
 
FIXED
 
RATE
 
return.
 
Right
 
now,
 
you
 
can
 
lock
 
in
 
18%
 
APR
 
on
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
great
 
options
 
for
 
over
 
80
 
days.

And

Let's
 
start
 
on
 
@solana
 
Weird
 
place
 
to
 
start,
 
I
 
agree,
 
but
 
hear
 
me
 
out:
 
@RateX_Dex
 
has
 
fragBTC
 
fixed
 
APR
 
at
 
5.5%
 
@ExponentFinance
 
has
 
it
 
at
 
4.45%
 
As
 
far
 
as
 
I
 
know ,
 
those
 
are
 
the
 
highest
 
fixed
 
rate
 
APRs
 
on
 
BTC
 
anywhere.
 
I
 
really
 
hope
 
these
 
become
 
composable.

geting
 
10.39%

First,
 
what
 
is
 
csUSDL?
 
►
 
csUSDL
 
is
 
a
 
Morpho-Lend-W rapped
 
form
 
of
 
wUSDL
 
►
 
wUSDL
 
is
 
a
 
@Paxos
 
issued
 
tbill-yield
 
stablecoin
 
csUSDL
 
gets
 
more
 
yield
 
than
 
wUSDL
 
since
 
it
 
has
 
the
 
additional
 
yield
 
from
 
Morpho
 
lending
 
&
 
morpho
 
emissions.
 
This
 
adds
 
up
 
to
 
a
 
base
 
rate
 
of
 
3.74%
 
APY.

So
 
why
 
is
 
the
 
PT-csUSDL
 
at
 
10%?
 
Pendle
 
lets
 
you
 
lock
 
in
 
10%
 
tokens
 
when
 
using
 
csUSDL.
 
This
 
gives
 
csUSDL
 
an
 
implied
 
APY
 
of
 
8-12%.
 
Pendle
 
lets
 
you
 
lock
 
in
 
10%
 
fixed-rate/date.
 
And
 
Morpho
 
lets
 
you
 
leverage
 
that.

And

Both

((Leverage-1)

to

what
 
your
 
APR
 
would
 
be
 
after
 
a

number

the
 
math
 
is
 
slightly
 
more
 
complex.

Morpho
 
uses
 
the

for

so
 
you
 
probably
 
don't

I
 
personally

That's

We're

hosting
 
a
 
stablecoin
 
yield

competition
 
in
 
the
 
discord
 
right
 
now,
 
with
 
over
 
half
 
a
 
million
 
dollars
 
competing.
 
I
 
and
 
a
 
few
 
other
 
competitors
 
are
 
using
 
this
 
strategy
 
to
 
hopefully
 
churn
 
out
 
a
 
good
 
ROI
 
before
 
the
 
competition
 
ends.

It
 
may
 
be
 
the
 
right
 
time
 
to
 
bet
 
on
 
Black
 
Swans
 
As
 
I've
 
mentioned
 
before,
 
stability
 
pools
 
are
 
inherently
 
long
 
Black
 
Swans.
 
In
 
previous
 
cycles
 
@LiquityProtocol
 
's
 
stability
 
pool
 
hit
 
3-5%
 
daily
 
ROIs
 
during
 
massive
 
down
 
days
 
from
 
liquidations.
 
NOW
 
you
 
can
 
benefit
 
from
 
those
 
liquidations
 
without
 
needing
 
to
 
manually
 
sell
 
the
 
ETH
 
derivates
 
you
 
receive
 
from
 
liquidation.
 
I.E.,
 
with
 
@k3_capital
 
's
 
sBOLD
 
you
 
get
 
all
 
liquidations
 
auto-compounded
 
back
 
into
 
sBOLD.
 
And
 
now
 
it's
 
on
 
@spectra_finance
 
.
 
►
 
YTs
 
give
 
you
 
leveraged
 
exposure
 
to
 
Black
 
Swans.
 
►
 
LPs
 
give
 
you
 
exposure
 
to
 
both
 
black
 
swans
 
and
 
airdrops.
 
►
 
PTs
 
get
 
you
 
a
 
nice
 
13%
 
fixed
 
rate
 
(coming
 
to
 
@eulerfinance
 
soon!)

@FalconStable

sUSDF

now
 
on
 
@eulerfinance
 
with
 
$2M
 
of
 
$USDC
 
to
 
borrow .
 
Max
 
APY
 
of
 
72%
 
currently ,
 
but
 
do
 
be
 
mindful
 
of
 
borrow
 
rates.
 
Oftentimes
 
when
 
I
 
post
 
these

someone
 
will
 
borrow
 
100%
 
of
 
the
 
available
 
funds
 
and

the
 
strategy .
 
Don't

The
 
real
 
@plumenetwork
 
alpha
 
is
 
on
 
@roycoprotocol
 
.
 
The
 
beauty
 
of
 
these
 
10-18%
 
yields
 
is
 
that
 
they're
 
non-leveraged.
 
The
 
catch
 
is
 
that
 
WHILE
 
THERE'S
 
NO
 
LOCK
 
UP,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
the
 
position
 
for
 
90Days
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
get
 
your
 
yield.
 
If
 
you
 
withdraw
 
early ,
 
you
 
lose
 
the
 
yield.

with
 
some
 
beautiful
 
non-leveraged
 
yields
 
on
 
@_WOOFi
 
.
 
Notably
 
20%
 
APR
 
on
 
USDT
 
paid
 
in
 
$WMNT .
 
It's
 
important
 
to
 
have
 
non-leveraged
 
stables
 
available
 
to
 
you
 
both
 
for
 
deploying
 
when
 
an
 
opportunity
 
arises
 
and
 
for
 
emergency
 
unwinding.
 
Lend
 
positions
 
like
 
this,
 
especially
 
at
 
20%
 
are
 
a
 
key
 
part
 
of
 
any
 
good
 
risk-adjusted
 
portfolio.

@ResolvLabs
 
is
 
insane.
 
30-day
 
APR
 
for
 
their
 
SENIOR
 
TRANCHE
 
is
 
7.5%
 
30-day
 
APR
 
for
 
their
 
junior
 
tranche
 
(
 
$RLP)
 
is
 
13%
 
Getting
 
a
 
consistent
 
>7%
 
yield
 
with
 
senior
 
tranche
 
exposure
 
is
 
a
 
bigger
 
deal
 
than
 
most
 
people
 
realize.
 
Why?
 
Because
 
the
 
entire
 
junior
 
tranche
 
(~47%
 
of
 
the
 
protocol)
 
acts
 
as
 
an
 
insurance
 
layer
 
with
 
burden-of-first
 
loss
 
before
 
the
 
senior
 
tranche
 
peg
 
would
 
ever
 
be
 
affected.

And
 
so,
 
given
 
these
 
consistently
 
high
 
yields,
 
let's
 
look
 
at
 
leverage
 
for
 
@ResolvLabs

►
 
wstUSR/USDC:
 
15.24%
 
APR
 
+

PT-wstUSR/USDC:
 
25%

(fixed

$14M

►
 
RLP/USDC:
 
35.5%

@infinifilabs
 
has
 
joined
 
the

Shortly
 
after
 
launching,
 
they
 
skyrocketed
 
to
 
$27M
 
TVL
 
and
 
continue
 
to
 
grow ,
 
having
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
competitive
 
Pendle
 
PT
 
and
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
best
 
base
 
rates
 
for
 
stablecoins
 
out
 
there.
 
➢
 
12.25%
 
fixed

➢
 
9.12%
 
APY
 
senior
 
tranche
 
(+points)
 
➢
 
14%
 
to
 
16%
 
APY
 
junior
 
locking
 
APYs
 
Once
 
these
 
hit
 
leveraging
 
markets,
 
we'll
 
be
 
cooking
 
with
 
fire.

Lazy
 
Summer
 
is
 
very
 
active...
 
Like
 
I
 
mentioned
 
before,
 
it's
 
incredibly
 
important
 
to
 
have
 
some
 
portion
 
of
 
your
 
portfolio
 
in
 
non-leveraged
 
positions.
 
Much
 
better
 
if
 
those
 
positions
 
are
 
already
 
in
 
your
 
favorite
 
base
 
asset
 
of
 
choice
 
(USDC,
 
ETH,
 
BTC,
 
etc).
 
@summerfinance_
 
is
 
the
 
perfect
 
such
 
place.
 
USDC
 
yields
 
from
 
6%-9.6%
 
base
 
rate
 
PLUS
 
15%-40%
 
APR
 
in
 
SUMR
 
tokens.
 
Note:
 
the
 
SUMR
 
tokens
 
are
 
based
 
on
 
an
 
implied
 
FDV
 
of
 
250M.
 
If
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
mine
 
these
 
pre-launch
 
tokens,
 
definitely
 
use
 
our
 
ref
 
link
 
on
 
this
 
one:

Finally ,
 
just
 
use
 
@Contango_xyz
 
For
 
one-click
 
leverage
 
in-and-out,
 
especially
 
for
 
positions
 
you
 
plan
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
for
 
months,
 
Contango's
 
auto-leverage
 
is
 
best-in-class.
 
I
 
typically
 
put
 
$100K
 
as
 
the
 
minimum
 
size,
 
not
 
because
 
I
 
plan
 
to
 
put
 
that
 
into
 
a
 
position,
 
but
 
rather
 
because
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
the
 
positions
 
aren't
 
easily
 
diluted.
 
Here
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
great
 
yields
 
that
 
can
 
handle
 
>$100K
 
principal.
 
Be
 
mindful
 
though,
 
do
 
not
 
ape
 
into
 
soon-to-expire
 
PTs.
 
The
 
APRs
 
look
 
good,
 
but
 
typically
 
you
 
won't
 
ROI
 
after
 
entry
 
and
 
exit
 
fees
 
if
 
you're
 
in
 
for
 
less
 
than
 
a
 
month.
 
I
 
like...
 
⇒
 
Both
 
@levelusd
 
PTs
 
(Sept):
 
47%
 
&
 
50%
 
APR
 
⇒
 
PT-USDS
 
(AUG):
 
40%
 
APR
 
(this
 
just
 
got
 
a
 
liquidity
 
refill,
 
HIGHL Y
 
underrated)
 
⇒
wstUSR
 
on
 
Morpho:
 
36%
 
APR
 
(mentioned
 
earlier
 
in
 
the
 
thread)

@LFJ_gg

Two
 
of
 
my
 
favorites
 
are
 
on
 
the
 
protocol
 
formerly
 
known
 
as
 
Trader
 
Joes.
 
A
 
few
 
things
 
to
 
note
 
here:
 
1.
 
Those
 
8%
 
APRs
 
are
 
AVERAGES,
 
unlike
 
many
 
other
 
protocols,
 
LFJ
 
advertises
 
the
 
average
 
APR
 
rather
 
than
 
unobtainable
 
single-tick
 
APR.
 
That
 
means
 
the
 
8%
 
is
 
highly
 
achievable
 
and
 
even
 
beatable.
 
2.

avBTC

currently
 
getting
 
~7.5%
 
which
 
is
 
WILD
 
for
 
a

I
 
wish
 
you
 
could
 
see
 
under
 
the
 
hood
 
on
 
this
 
one,
 
but
 
I
 
imagine
 
it's
 
likely
 
borrowing
 
stables
 
against
 
BTC
 
collateral
 
and
 
participating
 
in
 
similar
 
strategies
 
as
 
the
 
stable
 
vaults.

@BlackholeDex
 

Here,
 
you
 
see
 
the
 
maximum
 
possible
 
yield
 
(single
 
tick
 
APR)
 
but,
 
since
 
it's
 
correlated,
 
you
 
can
 
actually
 
go
 
fairly
 
tight
 
(1-3
 
ticks).
 
A
 
reasonable
 
estimate
 
for
 
these
 
pairs
 
is
 
around
 
5-8%

@SiloFinance
 
I
 
done
 
told
 
you
 
guys
 
Avalanche
 
has
 
somehow
 
become
 
the
 
BTC
 
yield
 
chain.
 
Anywho,
 
just
 
lending
 
BTC
 
derivatives
 
on
 
Silo
 
is
 
generating
 
up
 
to
 
8%.
 
➢
 
BTC.b:
 
4.3%
 
➢
 
xBTC
 
(@StreamDefi
 
):
 
5.52%
 
➢
 
savBTC:
 
7.5%
 
NOW ,
 
for
 
xBTC
 
and
 
savBTC,
 
those
 
are
 
just
 
the
 
intrinsic
 
yields.
 
SO,
 
if
 
you
 
wanted
 
to
 
get
 
more
 
APR,
 
all
 
you'd
 
want
 
to
 
do
 
is
 
click
 
Borrow ...
 
Leveraging
 
savBTC,
 
e.g.,
 
at
 
5x
 
against
 
a
 
0.5%
 
borrow
 
rate
 
would
 
give
 
you
 
19.5%
 
APR
 
I
 
wouldn't
 
leverage
 
xBTC
 
unless
 
the
 
borrow
 
rate
 
was
 
under
 
the
 
organic
 
APR
 
you
 
can
 
find
 
on
 
the
 
Stream
 
dashboard
 
page
 
(currently
 
5.52%)

@D2_Finance
 
gives
 
me
 
salt
 
for
 
not
 
talking
 
about
 
them
 
enough
 
BUT,
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
good
 
BTC
 
yield.
 
This
 
one
 
may
 
go
 
under
 
the
 
radar
 
because
 
the
 
name
 
doesn't
 
shout
 
BTC,
 
BUT
 
it's
 
basically
 
an
 
options-type
 
play
 
where
 
you
 
get
 
an
 
aggressive
 
yield
 
if
 
it
 
stays
 
within
 
a
 
certain
 
range
 
but
 
also
 
limited
 
downside
 
and
 
capture
 
full
 
upside
 
if
 
it
 
breaks
 
up.
 
TL;DR:
 
roughly
 
8%
 
consistently ,
 
but
 
some
 
niche
 
risk
 
cases

@MidasR WA
 
has
 
two
 
vaults...
 
mBTC
 
and
 
mevBTC
 
Both
 
getting
 
around
 
2.3%
 
APR.
 
Which
 
isn't
 
nuts,
 
BUT
 
Midas
 
doesn't

a

So...
 
But
 
also,
 
for
 
BTC
 
whales
 
out
 
there,
 
2.3%
 
is
 
actually
 
not
 
bad.
 
And
 
these
 
are
 
composable.

Coming
 
Soon...
 
@union_build
 
@AuroBTC
 
is
 
coming,
 
and
 
it
 
should
 
make
 
big
 
waves.
 
If
 
@0xkaiserkarel
 
can
 
pull
 
off
 
double
 
digit
 
yields
 
on
 
BTC,
 
I'll
 
be
 
talking
 
about
 
it
 
much

Also
 
coming

@yieldbasis
 
This
 
is
 
@newmichwill
 
's
 
BTC
 
strategy
 
vault,
 
which
 
is
 
very
 
similar
 
to
 
what
 
we
 
used
 
to
 
call
 
PDN
 
(pseudo
 
delta
 
neutral)
 
back
 
in
 
the
 
day.
 
I
 
really
 
hope
 
this
 
succeeds,
 
though
 
DeFi
 
is
 
littered
 
with
 
the
 
graves
 
of
 
PDN
 
vaults
 
that
 
died
 
through
 
rebalancing
 
and
 
realized
 
IL.
 
But
 
if
 
anyone
 
can
 
pull
 
it
 
off,
 
it's
 
the
 
curve
 
lads
 
/

Aave's

1.
 
0.44%

2.
 
2.65%
 
borrow
 
cost
 
(lower
 
than

market)
 
At
 
20x
 
leverage,
 
that's
 
16.85%
 
net.
 
AND
 
THERE'S
 
2
 
BILLION

OF

TO

After

I
 
noticed
 
good

@swellnetworkio

Turns

you
 
can

up
 
weETH
 
and
 
wstETH
 
for
 
20-27%
 
over
 
there.

As
 
a
 
reminder ,
 
these
 
positions
 
are
 
best
 
when
 
they
 
have
 
deep
 
liquidity ,
 
aren't

you
 
anticipate

@ResolvLabs
 
If
 
you're
 
bullish,
 
there
 
is
 
virtually
 
no
 
better
 
stablecoin
 
play
 
than
 
$RLP .
 
It's
 
similar
 
to
 
having
 
a
 
leveraged
 
exposure
 
to
 
basis
 
trading,
 
which
 
is
 
inherently
 
long
 
positive
 
funding.
 
17%
 
7-Day
 
APR
 
is
 
NUTS.
 
And
 
you
 
can
 
leverage
 
this.

$RLP

up,

Granted,
 
there's
 
only
 
$700K
 
to

so
 
be
 
mindful
 
not
 
to
 
push

high.
 
But
 
at

you'd
 
get
 
93%
 
APR
 
(based
 
on
 
today's
 
RLP
 
yield).

Excited

@TermMaxFi
 
get
 
some
 
liquidity
 

This
 
is
 
arguably
 
the
 
best
 
@reservoir_xyz
 
yield
 
out
 
there.
 
Reservoir
 
has
 
a
 
VERY
 
reliable
 
srUSD
 
yield,
 
and
 
you
 
can
 
borrow
 
500K
 
at
 
a
 
FIXED
 
RATE
 
of
 
4.18%
 
right
 
now.
 
At

In
 
the
 
froth,
 
people
 
borrow
 
more
 
aggressively
 
MEANING,
 
teams
 
like
 
@gauntlet_xyz
 
win
 
big.
 
Their
 
lend
 
aggregator
 
vault
 
is
 
arguably
 
the
 
best
 
in
 
town,
 
and
 
something
 
tells
 
me
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
composable
 
in
 
the
 
not-too-distant
 
future.
 
It's
 
not
 
an
 
eye-popping
 
yield
 
at
 
9%,
 
BUT
 
for
 
a
 
USDC-in/USDC-out
 
non-leveraged
 
position,
 
it's
 
incredible.

Speaking
 
of
 
USDC-in/USDC-out,
 
@infinifilabs
 
You
 
can
 
loop
 
PT-iUSD
 
on
 
Morpho
 
for
 
about
 
30%
 
APR.
 
BUT,
 
and
 
here's
 
the
 
good
 
part,
 
there's
 
$5.5M
 
to
 
borrow .
 
h/t
 
to
 
@SteakhouseFi
 
for
 
curating
 
this
 
primo
 
market
 
REMINDER:
 
I
 
love
 
these
 
PTs
 
because
 
you
 
can
 
exit
 
fully
 
into
 
USDC
 
when
 
you're
 
done.

You
 
can
 
LP
 
BOLD-WUSDN
 
on
 
Balancer
 
for
 
something
 
like
 
16%
 
APR.
 
OR
 
you
 
can
 
go
 
to
 
Aura
 
and
 
get
 
26%
 
APR.
 
The
 
beauty
 
of
 
this
 
is
 
you
 
don't
 
take
 
on
 
any
 
leverage
 
risks.
 
This
 
is

of

then
 
runs

Most
 
of
 
your
 
stablecoins
 
SHOULD
 
NOT
 
BE
 
LEVERAGED.
 
This
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
enter

exit
 
other
 
positions
 
rapidly
 
when
 
you
 
need
 
to.
 
Why
 
not
 
get
 
8-15%
 
on
 
those
 
liquid
 
stables.

Withdrawal
 
Fees
 
These
 
are
 
much
 
more
 
common
 
and
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
fastest
 
ways
 
to
 
lose

When
 
a
 
protocol
 
taxes
 
you
 
a
 
1%
 
exit
 
fee,
 
that's
 
a
 
10%
 
loss
 
on
 
your
 
position
 
if
 
you're
 
10x
 
leveraged.
 
Many
 
stablecoins
 
and
 
vaults
 
have
 
withdraw
 
fees
 
between
 
0.05%
 
and
 
1%.

Redemption
 
Fees
 
Nearly
 
identical
 
to
 
a
 
withdrawal
 
fee,
 
this
 
is
 
typically
 
used
 
to
 
convert
 
a
 
relatively
 
illiquid
 
asset
 
back
 
into
 
its
 
more
 
native
 
counterpart.
 
You
 
could
 
imagine
 
a
 
yield-wrapped
 
stable,
 
BTC,
 
or
 
ETH
 
that
 
has
 
a
 
0.1%
 
fee
 
to
 
redeem
 
for
 
the
 
underlying
 
USDC,
 
BTC,
 
or
 
ETH.
 
These
 
typically
 
push
 
you
 
to
 
either
 
eat
 
the
 
fee
 
or
 
to
 
use
 
liquidity ,
 
which
 
may
 
or
 
may
 
not
 
have
 
a
 
healthy
 
peg.
 
Again,
 
deleveraging
 
positions
 
with
 
exit
 
fees
 
(like
 
redemption
 
fees)
 
means
 
you
 
eat
 
that
 
cost
 
MULTIPLIED
 
by
 
your
 
leverage.

Getting
 
"Zapped"
 
Zapping-in
 
to
 
a
 
position
 
is
 
great
 
for
 
ease
 
of
 
use,
 
BUT
 
many
 
protocols
 
will
 
use
 
zap
 
features
 
to
 
route
 
through
 
their
 
own
 
liquidity
 
at
 
higher-than
 
necessary
 
slippage
 
to
 
gobble
 
up
 
some
 
revenue
 
every
 
time
 
someone
 
opens
 
a
 
position.
 

This
 
means
 
you
 
enter
 
a
 
position
 
at
 
a
 
loss
 
and
 
at
 
a
 
lower
 
principal
 
than
 
you
 
would
 
have
 
had
 
to
 
if
 
you
 
just
 
converted
 
the
 
assets
 
on
 
your
 
own
 
before
 
entering.
 
Many
 
protocols
 
do
 
use
 
the
 
best
 
aggregators
 
for
 
zapping
 
and
 
take
 
zero
 
cut
 
of
 
zapped
 
assets,
 
but
 
some
 
protocols
 
charge
 
for
 
what
 
is
 
affectively
 
"zapping
 
as
 
a
 
service"
 
and
 
so
 
whenever
 
you
 
see
 
a
 
zap
 
feature,
 
you
 
should
 
check
 
first.

Swap
 
fees
 
(auto-leveraging
 
pains)
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
pretty
 
common
 
way
 
to
 
get
 
rekt
 
with
 
auto-leveraging
 
protocols.
 
Most
 
protocols
 
charge
 
fees
 
on
 
100%
 
of
 
assets
 
swapped
 
to
 
leverage
 
up,
 
typically
 
something
 
like
 
a
 
flashloan
 
fee.
 
But
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
remember ,
 
if
 
you're
 
10x
 
leveraged,
 
that
 
fee
 
is
 
multiplied
 
by
 
9.
 
So
 
a
 
0.1%
 
fee
 
becomes
 
nearly
 
1%
 
loss
 
to
 
enter ,
 
and
 
then
 
the
 
same
 
to
 
exit.
 
You
 
can
 
avoid
 
this
 
by
 
manually
 
entering
 
positions
 
or,
 
of
 
course,
 
cheat
 
looping.

So
 
now
 
let's
 
look
 
at
 
easy
 
ways
 
to
 
avoid
 
getting
 
farmed.
 
1.
 
WAIT
 
FOR
 
REDEMPTION.
 
Most
 
redemption
 
fees
 
are
 
for
 
instant
 
redemptions.
 
Protocols
 
will
 
often
 
have
 
an
 
option
 
to
 
do
 
a
 
native
 
redemption
 
without
 
eating
 
a
 
fee
 
to
 
exit.
 
The
 
fee
 
is
 
effectively
 
making
 
sure
 
the
 
protocol
 
doesn't
 
take
 
a
 
loss
 
for
 
exiting
 
positions
 
to
 
service
 
withdrawals
 
immediately .
 
Waiting
 
7
 
days
 
for
 
no
 
fee
 
instead
 
of
 
eating
 
0.5%
 
fee
 
for
 
instant
 
redeemability
 
is
 
affectively
 
equal
 
to
 
a
 
26%
 
APR
 
position.

Cheat
 
loop
 
I've
 
made
 
a
 
video
 
about
 
this:
 
https://t.co/Z4TkSSVd8q
 
But
 
the
 
basic
 
idea
 
is
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
avoid
 
eating
 
leveraging
 
fees
 
by
 
starting
 
with
 
your
 
notional
 
and
 
borrowing
 
until
 
your
 
desired
 
principal
 
remains
 
the
 
position
 
equity .
 
It
 
sounds
 
complex,
 
but
 
it's
 
not
 
(watch
 
the
 
video).

Use
 
limit
 
orders
 
to
 
exit
 
assets
 
that
 
have
 
low
 
liquidity
 
but
 
are
 
value-accuring
 
Assets
 
like
 
RLP
 
or
 
sUSDe
 
that
 
don't
 
have
 
decentralized
 
redemption,
 
meaning
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
either
 
KYC
 
OR
 
sell
 
through
 
liquidity
 
to
 
exit.
 
While
 
this
 
isn't
 
always
 
terrible,
 
you
 
can
 
occasionally
 
get
 
burnt.
 
The
 
solution
 
is
 
to
 
set
 
limit
 
orders
 
at
 
NAV
 
on
 
something
 
like
 
@CoWSwap
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
exit
 
at
 
NAV
 
without
 
losing
 
any
 
of
 
your
 
precious
 
yield.

Don't
 
deposit
 
If
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
high
 
mint
 
/
 
deposit
 
fee.
 
When
 
there's
 
a
 
good
 
position
 
that
 
has
 
a
 
high
 
minting
 
or
 
deposit
 
fee,
 
typically
 
it's
 
best
 
to
 
buy
 
the
 
asset
 
directly
 
from
 
a
 
DEX
 
rather
 
than
 
mint.
 
If
 
you
 
can't,
 
then
 
you
 
may
 
consider
 
avoiding
 
the
 
strategy
 
altogether/

When
 
deleveraging,
 
try
 
to
 
use
 
external
 
capital.
 
If
 
you're
 
in
 
leveraged
 
positions,
 
instead
 
of
 
deleveraging
 
by
 
swapping,
 
try
 
to
 
pay
 
off
 
your
 
debt
 
with
 
external
 
capital,
 
so
 
you
 
can
 
withdraw
 
the
 
collateral
 
instead.
 
This
 
will
 
allow
 
you
 
to
 
use
 
redemption
 
or
 
withdraw-at-NA V
 
rather
 
than
 
having
 
to
 
sell
 
to
 
unwind.

lent

and
 
borrowed

Let
 
me
 
explain.
 
Summer
 
Pump
 
gives
 
a
 
3–6%
 
additional
 
APR
 
to
 
newly
 
minted
 
weETH.
 
That
 
makes
 
the
 
net
 
APR
 
6-9%
 
just
 
for
 
minting
 
weETH.
 
I
 
walk
 
through
 
the
 
math
 
in
 
this
 
thread
 
here:

You

for
 
a
 
remarkably
 
high
 
APR
 
(@eulerfinance

an
 
excellent
 
locale
 
for

BUT,
 
to
 
avoid
 
leverage,
 
try
 
this:
 
1.
 
Mint
 
weETH
 
2.
 
Deposit
 
onto
 
you
 
favorite
 
money
 
market
 
3.
 
Borrow
 
stables
 
at
 
50%
 
LTV
 
at
 
~5%
 
APR
 
From
 
there,
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
options

Avoid

USDC-out

@infiniFi_
 
If
 
you

USDC
 
but
 
swap
 
to
 
USDe
 
or
 
USDT ,
 
you'll
 
eat
 
slippage
 
when
 
entering/exiting
 
positions.
 
INSTEAD,
 
consider
 
USDC-denominated
 
yields.

The
 
world
 
is
 
your
 
oyster .
 
The
 
idea
 
is
 
that
 
you
 
mint
 
weETH,
 
lend
 
it
 
(locking
 
in
 
your
 
6-9%
 
collateral
 
APR),
 
then
 
borrow
 
stables
 
at
 
a
 
lower
 
rate
 
than
 
you
 
farm
 
them.
 
You
 
avoid
 
leveraging
 
headaches
 
while
 
benefiting
 
from
 
this
 
explosion
 
of
 
stablecoin
 
yields.

SolvBTC.jup

permissionless
 
(I.E.,
 
non-KYC)
 
meaning
 
anyone
 
can

it

If

this

a

Currently ,
 
it

you

rate).
 
0.15
 
ETHFI
 
÷
 
$1K
 
×
 
365
 
=
 
7.5%
 
additional
 
APR
 
while
 
this
 
campaign
 
lasts.
 
On
 
top
 
of
 
that,
 
you
 
also
 
get
 
5%
 
cash
 
back
 
on
 
any
 
spend
 
you
 
do
 
on
 
the
 
card.
 
Shameless
 
Shill:
 
If
 
you
 
use
 
the
 
Dojo
 
Link,
 
you
 
get
 
$50
 
cashback
 
on
 
the
 
first
 
$1K
 
spent.
 
That's
 
a
 
5%
 
ROI.

GOOD
 
OLD
 
FASHIONED
 
AAVE
 
The
 
most
 
timeless
 
BTC
 
strategy
 
has
 
always
 
been
 
1.
 
Lend
 
on
 
Aave
 
2.
 
Borrow
 
stables
 
or
 
ETH
 
3.
 
Get
 
a
 
yield
 
on
 
the
 
stales
 
or
 
ETH
 
4.
 
Sell
 
the
 
yield
 
for
 
more
 
BTC
 

IMO,
 
this
 
will
 
never
 
stop
 
being
 
a
 
good
 
strategy
 
as
 
long
 
as
 
you
 
can
 
get
 
a
 
higher
 
yield
 
on
 
the
 
borrowed
 
asset
 
than
 
the
 
interest
 
you
 
pay.
 
EXAMPLE:
 
$100K
 
WBTC
 
Collateral:
 
+0.02%
 
APY
 
Borrow
 
$50K
 
USDT :
 
5%
 
APR
 
(-2.5%
 
Net)
 
Get
 
30%
 
APR
 
on
 
stables
 
on
 
@eulerfinance
 
(+15%
 
Net)
 
Total
 
Yield:
 
0.02%
 
-
 
2.5%
 
+
 
15%
 
=
 
12.52%
 
APR

Contango
 
Never
 
Sleeps
 
@Contango_xyz
 
still
 
boasts
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
best
 
BTC
 
yields
 
loops
 
out
 
there.
 
NOTE:
 
Do
 
not
 
enter
 
the
 
May
 
Expiring
 
PTs,
 
the
 
yield
 
looks
 
great,
 
but
 
it's
 
not
 
worth
 
8
 
days
 
of
 
yield
 
to
 
enter
 
and
 
exit.
 
BUT,
 
the
 
Jun
 
expiring
 
PTs
 
looks
 
really
 
nice,
 
and
 
you
 
can
 
also
 
pointsmax
 
LBTC
 
for
 
a
 
positive
 
yield.

Roger's
 
Rate
 
Arbitrage
 
I
 
mentioned
 
this
 
before,
 
but
 
I
 
still
 
think
 
it's
 
brilliant.
 
@OG_RogerT ennis
 
(brilliant
 
strategist
 
for
 
@628Labs
 
)
 
came
 
up
 
with
 
this
 
idea.
 
In
 
short,
 
you
 
use
 
funding
 
rate
 
arbitrage
 
while
 
maintaining
 
your
 
desired
 
long
 
exposure
 
to
 
BTC
 
with
 
@protocol_fx
 
because
 
f(x)
 
lets
 
you
 
leverage
 
(for
 
capital
 
efficiency)
 
without
 
paying
 
any
 
funding
 
or
 
borrow
 
cost.
 
Example:
 
$10K
 
BTC
 
Starting
 
►
 
@HyperliquidX
 
BTC
 
Funding
 
Rate:
 
42%
 
►
 
Long
 
on
 
F(X):
 
$6K
 
Margin,
 
3x
 
Leverage
 
($18K
 
Long
 
Exposure)
 
►
 
Short
 
on
 
HL:
 
$4K
 
Margin,
 
2x
 
Leverage
 
($8K
 
Short
 
Exposure)
 
Total
 
BTC
 
Exposure:
 
$18K-$8K
 
=
 
$10K
 
This
 
means
 
you
 
still
 
have
 
$10K
 
BTC
 
Exposure
 
BUT
 
you're
 
also
 
getting
 
33.6%
 
Net
 
APR
 
on
 
the
 
whole
 
strategy .
 
Roger's
 
brilliant,
 
give
 
him
 
a
 
follow .

THANKS
 
FOR
 
READING!
 
I
 
hope
 
you're
 
enjoying
 
$BTC
 
ATH
 
today
 
and
 
able
 
to
 
squeeze
 
out
 
some
 
extra
 
ROI
 
with
 
yields.
 
Note:
 
Many
 
ambassadors
 
mentioned,
 
so
 
assume
 
any
 
protocol
 
mentioned
 
is
 
or
 
may
 
someday
 
be
 
an
 
ambassador .
 
And
 
remember ...
