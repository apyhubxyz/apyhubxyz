{"prompt": "Design a delta‑neutral ETH basis trade using Liquity, Maple syrupUSDC, and Drift.", "response": "Long wstETH; post to Liquity; borrow BOLD at ~3.5% fixed with ~50% LTV; swap BOLD→syrupUSDC; bridge to Solana; deposit as Drift margin; open a 2× ETH short sized to offset the wstETH long. Target ≈21.5% APR from staking, margin yield, incentives, and short funding. Maintain LTV < 70% and rebalance on 25–30% ETH rallies.", "tags": ["ETH", "basis", "Liquity", "Drift", "Maple", "delta‑neutral"]}
{"prompt": "How do I check the NAV for a yield‑bearing stable like cUSDO to find arbitrage?", "response": "On Etherscan: open the token contract → 'Read as Proxy' → find 'previewRedeem' → enter a large share amount (e.g., 1,000,000) → divide returned assets by shares to get NAV. Compare DEX price versus NAV; sell at premium or buy at discount. If listed on Pendle, the info tab often shows NAV directly.", "tags": ["NAV", "stablecoins", "arbitrage", "how‑to"]}
{"prompt": "Non‑leveraged >10% APY stablecoin options with USDC in/out?", "response": "Use Pendle PTs (fix 12–18% for 1–3 months) or Infinifi (siUSD liquid, liUSD time‑laddered); both allow USDC‑in/USDC‑out paths. Curated lend aggregators like Gauntlet/SummerFi typically yield 8–12% base, sometimes higher with incentives, while keeping instant exit.", "tags": ["stables", "non‑leveraged", "fixed rate"]}
{"prompt": "What’s a safe leverage ceiling for looping PTs on Morpho?", "response": "Keep effective LTV < 90% even when LLTV is 91–96.5%. Understand the oracle (often Pendle AMM), give buffer for PT price drift, and prefer long‑dated PTs. Use cheat‑looping to minimize fees. Size only where borrow‑side liquidity is deep enough to avoid spiking rates.", "tags": ["leverage", "Morpho", "Pendle", "risk"]}
{"prompt": "Explain stability pools and why they’re ‘long black swans’.", "response": "Stability pools fund liquidations when collateralized loans get wiped out, paying providers in collateral (auto‑compounded in some vaults). In quiet markets they yield single‑digits, but during heavy deleveraging they can spike to outsized ROIs. They monetize downside volatility instead of getting wrecked by it.", "tags": ["stability pools", "liquidations", "tail risk"]}
{"prompt": "BTC basis carry with f(x) and Hyperliquid—what’s the idea?", "response": "Use f(x) for a 0%‑funding long (e.g., 3× with $6k margin = $18k notional) while shorting BTC on Hyperliquid (e.g., 2× with $4k margin = $8k). Net exposure is still +$10k long, but you harvest positive short funding on the $8k leg. Rebalance exposure and mind funding regime flips.", "tags": ["BTC", "basis", "funding"]}
{"prompt": "Avoiding fee traps when leveraging Pendle PTs?", "response": "Don’t auto‑zap multiple times. Borrow first, then supply collateral (cheat loop) so fees don’t multiply with each loop. Prefer scheduled, fee‑free redemptions over instant when available, and use limit orders on CoWSwap to target NAV on exit for wrappers without native redemptions.", "tags": ["fees", "cheat loop", "Pendle", "execution"]}
{"prompt": "Construct a non‑leveraged ETH yield above 12% with weETH.", "response": "Mint weETH (3% base + 3–6% seasonal pump), lend on a major market, borrow USDC at ~50% LTV (~5% cost), and farm a 12–20% APY stable (e.g., Pendle PT). Net ≈ 12–16% without recursive leverage. Keep collateral health healthy and avoid near‑expiry PTs.", "tags": ["ETH", "non‑leveraged", "Pendle", "weETH"]}
{"prompt": "What’s a quick checklist for sizing a new DeFi yield position?", "response": "Confirm 1:1 USDC exit for wrappers/PTs; TVL/depth > $1M; borrow‑side depth to avoid utilization spikes; oracle source and LLTV vs safe LTV (<90%); funding regime; entry/exit fees and slippage; breakeven horizon and expected longevity (>1 month for complex stacks).", "tags": ["risk", "checklist", "liquidity"]}
