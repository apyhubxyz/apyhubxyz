# Configuration Issues Fixed

## Overview
This document describes the configuration issues that were resolved to ensure proper environment variable loading and service initialization.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Redis Utility - Missing Variable Declaration ✅
**File:** `backend/src/utils/redis.ts`

**Problem:** The `redisAvailable` variable was referenced but never declared, causing undefined errors.

**Solution:** 
- Added `let redisAvailable = false;` declaration at module level
- Added event handlers to update `redisAvailable` based on connection status:
  - `connect` event sets it to `true`
  - `error` event sets it to `false`
  - `close` event sets it to `false`

### 2. Environment Variable Loading Order ✅
**File:** `backend/src/index.ts`

**Problem:** Environment variables were being loaded AFTER service imports, causing services to initialize with missing configuration values. This resulted in warnings:
- `⚠️ ZAPPER_API_KEY not configured`
- `⚠️ ALCHEMY_RPC_URL not configured`
- `⚠️ OpenAI API key not configured`

**Root Cause:** Services like `ZapperGraphQLFetcher`, `RealPositionFetcher`, and `AIService` create singleton instances when their modules are imported. If the `.env` file isn't loaded yet, they see empty environment variables.

**Solution:**
1. Moved `dotenv` import and configuration to the **very top** of `index.ts`
2. Load environment variables BEFORE importing any services
3. Added validation logging to confirm which keys are loaded:
   ```typescript
   console.log('🔑 OpenAI API Key:', process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY ? '✅ Loaded' : '❌ Missing');
   console.log('🔑 Zapper API Key:', process.env.ZAPPER_API_KEY ? '✅ Loaded' : '❌ Missing');
   console.log('🔑 Alchemy RPC URL:', process.env.ALCHEMY_RPC_URL ? '✅ Loaded' : '❌ Missing');
   ```

### 3. Environment Path Resolution ✅
**File:** `backend/src/index.ts`

**Problem:** The path to `.env` was using `process.cwd()` which can vary depending on where the command is run from.

**Solution:** Changed to use `__dirname` for reliable path resolution:
```typescript
const envPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '..', '..', '.env');
```

This ensures the path is always relative to the source file location, not the current working directory.

## Current Environment Status

### Required Variables (Must be configured)
- ✅ `ALCHEMY_RPC_URL` - For blockchain data
- ✅ `ZAPPER_API_KEY` - For position fetching
- ✅ `DATABASE_URL` - For Prisma

### Optional Variables
- ⚠️ `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For AI chat (fallback available)
- ⚠️ `REDIS_URL` - For caching (graceful degradation)

## Expected Server Output

After fixes, you should see:
```
📁 Loading .env from: /home/soheil/apyhubxyz/.env
✅ .env file loaded successfully
🔑 OpenAI API Key: ✅ Loaded (or ❌ Missing)
🔑 Zapper API Key: ✅ Loaded
🔑 Alchemy RPC URL: ✅ Loaded

🚀 Apyhub Backend API v2.0
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🌐 Server: http://localhost:3001
...
✨ Ready to accept requests!

⚠️  Redis not available. Caching disabled.
```

## Remaining Warnings (Expected)

### Redis Warning
```
⚠️ Redis not available. Caching disabled.
```
**Status:** This is EXPECTED if Redis is not installed/running.  
**Impact:** Low - The app works fine without Redis, just without caching.  
**To fix (optional):** Install and start Redis: `sudo systemctl start redis`

### OpenAI Warning
```
⚠️ OpenAI API key not configured. AI chat will use fallback responses.
```
**Status:** Optional - appears if OPENAI_API_KEY is missing.  
**Impact:** Low - AI chat uses intelligent fallback responses.  
**To fix:** Add valid OpenAI API key to `.env`

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

You should see all environment variables load correctly at startup, with no errors about Zapper or Alchemy configuration.

## Files Modified

1. `backend/src/utils/redis.ts` - Added `redisAvailable` variable and connection handlers
2. `backend/src/index.ts` - Moved environment loading to top of file

## Migration Notes

No breaking changes. The fixes are transparent to existing functionality and only improve the initialization order and error handling.
